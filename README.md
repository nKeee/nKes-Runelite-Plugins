  <h1>nKe's Modified Runelite Plugins</h1>
  <p>
    <i>Modified Runelite plugins to be used in conjunction with AutoHotKey for easier scripting and automation.</i>
  </p>
</div>
</br>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
  Goal is to modify common Runelite plugins for easier <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> scripting, this is achieved by rendering a colorized dot in a random position inside NPCs/Objects hitbox. </br>
  Antiban is achieved with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform">Boxâ€“Muller transform</a>, which should ensure humanlike distribution of clicks.
