  <h1>nKe's Modified Runelite Plugins</h1>

    <i>Modified Runelite plugins to be used in conjunction with AutoHotKey for easier scripting and automation.</i>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
  Small project to modify some of the most popular Runelite plugins so that they can be used with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> to automate tasks. </br>
  This is mainly achieved by rendering a colorized dot in a random position inside NPCs/Objects hitbox. </br>
  Antiban is done with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform">Boxâ€“Muller transform</a>, which should ensure humanlike distribution of dots inside hitboxes.
