  <h1>nKe's Modified Runelite Plugins</h1>
  <p>
    <i>Modified Runelite plugins to be used in conjunction with AutoHotKey for easier scripting and automation.</i>
  </p>
</div>
</br>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
  Goal is to modify common Runelite plugins for easier <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> scripting.</br>
  Plugins will work as their original counterparts, but with a few extra options to render a random dot inside npc/object hitbox. </br>
  Dot rendering is randomized using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform">Boxâ€“Muller transform</a>, which should ensure humanlike distribution of clicks.
